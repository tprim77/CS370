Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given all of the code except for the part that actually trains the AI. I created the code that tracks the wins and losses and makes sure the game trains as well as possible to reach a 100% win rate.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science: \
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? \
Computer scientists do a variety of things like study algorithms, data structures, and computational systems to solve problems, develop software, and design new technologies. Their work matters because it drives technological advancements, powers industries, and enhances daily lives with AI, cybersecurity, and more. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist? \
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by understanding their requirements, then plan and design a solution, implement and test it, and then optimize it to be more efficient. This structure helps to develop effective and maintainable software.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? \
My ethical responsibilities as a computer scientist to the end user and the organization include ensuring the privacy and security of user data, providing accurate and transparent information, and delivering great and reliable software. I also have the responsibility to avoid conflicts of interest, prioritize the well-being of users, and follow laws and regulations to maintain trust and integrity in my work.
